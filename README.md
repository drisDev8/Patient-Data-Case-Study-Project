## 📌 Patient Data Case-Study Project
This project analyzes patient healthcare data to uncover patterns in demographics, medical conditions, and treatment costs. Using descriptive and prescriptive analytics with interactive dashboards, it identifies high-risk groups and cost trends, delivering actionable insights for better decision-making.

## 📂 Datasets Information
**Key Columns:**  
a. Patient_ID → Unique identifier for each patient <br>
b. Age → Age of the patient <br>
c. Gender → Male / Female <br>
d. Medical Condition → Reported illness (e.g., Asthma, Diabetes) <br>
e. Admission Type → Emergency, Urgent, Elective <br>
f. Date of Admission → Patient admitted in the hospital <br>
g. Billing Amount → Final amount that the patient had to pay out of pocket after the insurance has paid its part <br>
h. Insurance Type → Coverage details <br>

Other Columns: Hospital, Room Number, Doctor, Discharge Date and others. <br><br>

**Usage:** Data is used for descriptive and prescriptive analytics to study disease prevalence, demographic trends, and patient cost optimization. <br>  
**Note:** Dataset has been cleaned and structured for analysis (e.g., standardizing format, creating demographic buckets).  

## 🎯Problem Statement:
Analyze the impact of demographics and admission types on healthcare costs and outcomes.

## 📊Objectives & Analysis:

1️⃣ **Demographic Analysis of Medical Conditions**
**Objective**: Identify the most prevalent medical conditions across different demographic groups.

Analysis Approach:
1. Analyzed the frequency of each medical condition across patient demographics.
2. Bucketed demographics (young, middle-aged, senior, male/female) for clear representation.
3. Ensured buckets were mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) for clarity.

2️⃣ **Patient Price Optimization**

**Objective**: Identify trends in billing and recommend cost-saving measures for patients.

Analysis Approach:
1. Calculated the average billing amount across different metrics.
2. Determined whether certain demographics or admission types resulted in higher or lower healthcare costs.
3. Linked findings back to demographic analysis for deeper insights.

## 🔍Key Insights
1. Hypertension is more prevalent among males (31% in middle-aged males being the highest risk group).
2. Females show higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes, indicating metabolic vulnerabilities.
3. Asthma is more common among the younger population, raising early-life respiratory concerns.
4. Seniors are more prone to arthritis and cancer, reflecting age-related degeneration.
5. Obesity is notably higher among middle-aged individuals, likely due to lifestyle changes.
6. UnitedHealthcare is the best choice for chronic conditions like Diabetes and Asthma.
7. Medicare is the recommended choice for serious or long-term illnesses i.e., Cancer at 17.4% savings.
8. Obesity has the highest potential for savings at 19.5% by Blue Cross for Obesity among all the medical condition.

   
## 🧠Skills Gained:
Through this case study, I gained hands-on experience in:

1.  **Sample Size Analysis** – validating whether the dataset is representative and sufficient for drawing insights.
2. **Data Cleaning** – handling inconsistent upper/lowercase entries and correcting data quality issues.
3. **Data Standardization** – ensuring consistent formats for demographics, medical conditions, and categories.
4. **Pivot Table Analysis** – building pivot tables for summarization and easier calculation of trends.
5. **Dashboarding in Excel** – creating both static and interactive dashboards.
6. **Excel Functions** – applying functions for data transformation and calculations.
7. **Date Formatting** – converting inconsistent date formats and grouping by months/years.
8. **Feature Engineering** – creating new buckets (e.g., age groups, billing ranges) for deeper analysis.
